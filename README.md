# v1.0.14

**Would you like to begin your adventure as one of the chosen by the destiny?**

The Chosen Ones reshapes the opening moments of your journey by granting access to a powerful pool of legendary equipment right at the start of the run. Instead of waiting for chance or progression, players are invited to select from a curated selection of high-tier gear and shape their strategy from the very first step.

The true strength of this mod lies not in raw power, but in freedom. By unlocking legendary options early, players can experiment with unconventional builds, explore new synergies, and fully realize character concepts that might otherwise take an entire run to assemble.

Whether you are testing ideas, refining strategies, or simply embracing a power-fantasy start, The Chosen Ones empowers you to play the way you imagine from the very beginning. 

This **Across the Obelisk** mod is designed for experimentation and players who want to begin their journey already feeling legendary.

## Features

* Opens a custom loot selection at the **very first node (Act 0)**
