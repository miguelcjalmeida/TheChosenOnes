# The Chosen Ones

**The Chosen Ones** is a quality-of-life / fun mod for **Across the Obelisk** that grants the player an immediate boost at the very start of a run.

As soon as a new game begins — on the **very first node of Act 0** — the mod automatically opens a **Legendary Equipment selection panel**, allowing you to choose powerful items before the adventure truly starts.

This is ideal for:

* Faster testing and debugging
* Experimental or overpowered runs
* Players who enjoy starting as true “chosen ones”

---

## ✨ Features

* 📦 Automatically opens a **Legendary Equipment reward** at the start of the run
* ⚔️ Uses the game’s **native loot / reward UI**
* 🧭 Triggers on the **first node of Act 0**, not tied to towns or events
* 🛠️ No configuration required — just install and play

---

## 🚀 How It Works

When a new run starts, the mod listens for the initialization of the first node (Act 0).
Once detected, it immediately triggers a **Legendary loot reward panel**, allowing you to pick your equipment before proceeding.

The loot is pulled directly from the game’s internal loot tables, ensuring compatibility with the base game and other mods.
